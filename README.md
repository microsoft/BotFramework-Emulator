## Nightly builds

Nightly builds are generated using the latest code. Therefore, they may not be stable, and most likely lack up to date documentation. These builds are better suited for more experienced users, although everyone is welcome to use them and provide feedback. Nightly builds of the V4 Emulator are available [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework-emulator-nightlies/releases).
